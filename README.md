## What is this?

This is a _very_ experimental tool designed to detect when a home security system is disarmed and check that it has been disarmed by one of a known list of persons, by checking for the presence of a known device (e.g. smart phone) that uniquely identifies that individual. If the event that no such device can be found, an alert can be sent.
